# Python Looping and Data Type Tasks

This document lists the tasks implemented in the accompanying notebook.  
The exercises focus on practicing `for` loops, iteration, and basic data type handling in Python.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Iterate Through a Tuple and Print Types
Create a tuple containing at least five different data types (integer, float, string, boolean, and complex).  
Use a `for` loop to iterate through the tuple and print each element along with its data type.

---

### 2. Print All Items from a List with a Custom Message
Create a list of four different city names.  
Use a `for` loop to print each city name followed by the phrase **"is a great place"**.

---

### 3. Print Each Character of a String with Its Index
Ask the user to enter a word.  
Use a `for` loop along with `enumerate()` to print each character and its corresponding index.

---

### 4. Sum of Elements in a List
Create a list of integers.  
Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all elements and print the total.

---

### 5. Count Booleans in a Tuple
Create a tuple containing multiple data types, including several `True` and `False` values.  
Use a `for` loop to count how many `True` values are present and print the count.

---

### 6. Check and Print Data Types from a List
Create a list with at least six elements of different data types.  
Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and print the data type of each element.

---

### 7. Check for Vowels in a String
Ask the user for a word.  
Use a `for` loop to check each character and print a message when a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) is found.

---

### 8. Print Square of Numbers from a Tuple
Create a tuple containing numbers from 1 to 5.  
Use a `for` loop to print the square of each number.

---

### 9. Print Elements of a List in Uppercase
Create a list of five words written in lowercase.  
Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and print each word in uppercase.

---

### 10. Count Numbers Greater Than 10 in a List
Create a list of integers.  
Use a `for` loop to count how many numbers in the list are greater than 10 and print the final count.
