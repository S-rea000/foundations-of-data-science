# Week 04 — Conditional Statements and Loops

This folder contains the assigned tasks and my solutions for Week 04 of the data science training program.

The focus of this week is on understanding and applying conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and looping constructs (`for` loops) in Python. These concepts are essential for controlling program flow, making decisions, and performing repetitive operations.

---

## Topics Covered

- Conditional statements and decision-making  
- Logical comparisons and branching  
- Iteration using `for` loops  
- Combining loops with conditional logic  
- Basic user input handling

## Contents

- `task_description.md` — Detailed list of assigned tasks for the week  
- `week_04_python_loops_tasks.ipynb` — Google Colab containing task implementations and solutions

## Notes

- Some programs require user input during execution.  
- The notebook is structured for learning and clarity rather than optimization.  
- This work reflects continuous learning as part of a structured data science training program.
