# Week 04 — Task Description: Conditional Statements and Loops

This document outlines the tasks for Week 04 of the data science training program.  
The focus of this week is on applying conditional statements and looping constructs to solve basic logical problems in Python.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Even or Odd Checker
- Prompt the user to enter an integer.
- Use `if` and `else` statements to check whether the number is even or odd.
- Print `"Even"` or `"Odd"` accordingly.

---

### 2. Positive, Negative, or Zero
- Prompt the user to enter a number.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to determine whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Print an appropriate message such as `"The number is positive."`.

---

### 3. Smallest of Three Numbers
- Prompt the user to enter three different numbers.
- Use conditional statements to determine which number is the smallest.
- Print the smallest number.

---

### 4. Grade Categorizer
- Prompt the user to enter a score between 0 and 100.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to categorize the score:
  - 90–100: Grade A  
  - 80–89: Grade B  
  - 70–79: Grade C  
  - Below 70: Fail
- Print the corresponding grade.

---

### 5. Simple Password Check
- Prompt the user to enter a password (for example, `"secret"`).
- Use a conditional statement to check if the entered password matches the correct password.
- Print `"Access granted"` if the password is correct; otherwise, print `"Access denied"`.

---

### 6. Multiples of 3 and 5
- Prompt the user to enter an integer `n`.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For each value:
  - Print `"Multiple of both"` if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
  - Print `"Multiple of 3"` if the number is divisible by 3 but not 5.
  - Print `"Multiple of 5"` if the number is divisible by 5 but not 3.
  - Otherwise, print the number itself.

---

### 7. Categorize Scores
- Create a list of scores, for example: `scores = [85, 42, 78, 99, 65]`.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through each score.
- Use conditional statements to categorize each score as:
  - `"Pass"` if the score is greater than or equal to 60
  - `"Fail"` if the score is less than 60
- Print each score along with its category.

---

### 8. Print Numbers from 1 to 10
- Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
- Each number should be printed on a new line.

---

### 9. Print Even Numbers Between 1 and 50
- Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

---

### 10. Print All Characters in a String
- Prompt the user to enter a string.
- Use a `for` loop to print each character of the string on a new line.

---

### 11. Count Vowels in a String
- Prompt the user to enter a string.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character.
- Use conditional statements to check whether a character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).
- Count and print the total number of vowels in the string.

---

### 12. Print Your Name 3 Times
- Prompt the user to enter their name.
- Use a `for` loop to print the name three times.

---

### 13. Simple Menu Selection
- Prompt the user to select an option:
  - 1 for "Start"
  - 2 for "Settings"
  - 3 for "Exit"
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to print the appropriate response:
  - If the user enters 1: print `"Game starting..."`
  - If the user enters 2: print `"Opening settings..."`
  - If the user enters 3 or any other value: print `"Exiting..."`

---

## Notes
- All tasks are implemented in the corresponding Jupyter notebook.
- Input-based programs require user interaction during execution.
- Code should be readable, logically structured, and free of runtime errors.
