# Week 01 — Python Basics (Assigned Tasks)

The following tasks were assigned as part of Week 01 during my data science training.  
These tasks focus on understanding Python fundamentals, data types, operators, and basic string operations.

---

## 1. Basic Arithmetic and Type Identification
- Create three variables: one integer, one float, and one complex number.
- Print each variable and use the `type()` function to confirm their data types.

## 2. Arithmetic with Mixed Types
- Create one integer variable (`a`) and one float variable (`b`).
- Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
- Print the `type()` of each result and observe how data types change.

## 3. Comparison Operators
- Define `x = 10` and `y = 7`.
- Print results of:
  - `x > y`
  - `x < y`
  - `x == y`
  - `x != y`
- Explain in comments why each result is `True` or `False`.

## 4. Boolean Variables
- Define a boolean variable `status = True`.
- Print its value and confirm its type.
- Reassign `status` to `False` and confirm the type again.

## 5. String Creation and Length
- Create a string variable (e.g., `"Hello World"`).
- Print its length using `len()`.
- Verify its type using `type()`.

## 6. String Indexing
- Use the string `"Python"`.
- Print each character.
- Print the first and last characters using negative indexing.

## 7. String Slicing
- Use the string `"Programming"`.
- Print:
  - Characters from index 0 to 4
  - Characters from index 3 to the end
  - A substring excluding the first two and last two characters

## 8. Exploring `len()` on Slices
- Slice `"Programming"` to obtain `"Program"`.
- Store it in a variable and compare its length with the original string.

## 9. String Methods — Case Conversion
- Use the string `"Hello, Python!"`.
- Print uppercase and lowercase versions.
- Print the original string to demonstrate immutability.

## 10. Combining Strings
- Combine `"Data"` and `"Science"` with a space in between.
- Print the combined string and its length.

## 11. In-Place vs Reassignment with String Methods
- Call `upper()` on a string without reassignment and print it.
- Reassign the result and print again.
- Comment on why the outputs differ.

## 12. Arithmetic Operator Precedence
- Define `a = 5`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`.
- Compare results of:
  - `a + b * c`
  - `(a + b) * c`
- Explain operator precedence in comments.

## 13. String Index Out of Range
- Attempt to access an invalid string index.
- Observe the `IndexError` and explain why it occurs.

## 14. Equality vs Identity Check
- Compare two strings using `==` and `is`.
- Explain the difference between equality and identity.

## 15. Complex Number Exploration
- Define a complex number.
- Print its real and imaginary parts.
- Confirm its type.

## 16. Floating-Point Comparison
- Compare `0.1 + 0.2` with `0.3`.
- Print both values and explain floating-point precision issues.
