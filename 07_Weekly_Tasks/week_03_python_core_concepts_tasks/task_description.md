# Week 03 — Task Description: Python Core Concepts

This document outlines the objectives and tasks for Week 03 of the data science training program.  
The purpose of this week is to strengthen foundational Python knowledge required for data analysis and machine learning workflows.

---

## Objectives

- Understand and apply Python numeric data types and arithmetic operations  
- Work with boolean logic and comparison operators  
- Perform string manipulation and formatting  
- Use core Python data structures: lists, tuples, sets, frozensets, and dictionaries  
- Apply commonly used built-in functions  
- Develop logical reasoning and code readability skills

---

## Task Requirements

### 1. Numeric Data Types
- Create and operate on integers, floats, and complex numbers  
- Perform arithmetic operations including exponentiation, modulo, and floor division  
- Observe type conversion behavior during arithmetic operations  

---

### 2. Boolean Logic and Comparisons
- Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)  
- Apply logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- Store comparison results in boolean variables  
- Use chained comparisons  

---

### 3. String Operations
- Create strings using single, double, and triple quotes  
- Access characters using indexing and slicing  
- Reverse strings using slicing  
- Apply common string methods  
- Understand string immutability  

---

### 4. String Formatting and Comparison
- Concatenate strings  
- Format strings using f-strings or `format()`  
- Compare strings lexicographically  
- Explore case-insensitive string comparison  

---

### 5. Lists
- Create and manipulate lists  
- Access and slice list elements  
- Add, remove, and modify elements  
- Sort and reverse lists  
- Use built-in aggregation functions on lists  

---

### 6. Tuples
- Create tuples and access elements  
- Perform tuple slicing  
- Unpack tuple values  
- Understand tuple immutability  

---

### 7. Sets and Frozensets
- Create and manipulate sets  
- Perform union, intersection, and difference operations  
- Understand uniqueness and unordered behavior  
- Use frozensets and observe immutability  
- Use frozensets as dictionary keys  

---

### 8. Dictionaries
- Create dictionaries and access values  
- Add, update, and remove key-value pairs  
- Work with nested dictionaries  
- Perform basic aggregation on dictionary values  

---

### 9. Built-in Functions
- Use common built-in functions such as `len()`, `type()`, `abs()`, `round()`, `sorted()`  
- Apply logical built-ins like `any()` and `all()`  

---

## Submission

- All tasks are implemented in the corresponding Google Colab 
- Code should be readable, logically structured, and properly commented  
- The notebook should run without errors
